This notebook uses the titanic dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) to predict if a certain passenger would survive, given certain parameters. The features used in the modelling are Passenger class, sex, age, number of silblings or spouses on the Titanic, number of parents or children on the Titanic, and ticket fare. The notebook first tests some several models, and then performs the final evaluation using a Random Forest Classifier. 
Test.
